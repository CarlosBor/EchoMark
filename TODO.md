Scan the rendered note for all embedded audio elements.

Collect their sources (file paths) and display them in a UI menu (e.g., modal or dropdown).

When the user selects an audio entry, insert a formatted text snippet into the note (e.g., markdown link plus timestamp placeholder).

The user edits the timestamp manually or via your pluginâ€™s UI.

Your plugin parses the note for these markers, extracts audio references and timestamps.

Use these to control playback on user interaction (e.g., clickable links or buttons).
